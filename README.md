# mona ðŸŽ¨
Bring art into your editor!

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by pleasant color palettes one would find on various works of art. It seeks to bring these palettes into your everyday development environment. Inspired by _A Starry Night_? Run `mona` on it and generate a color theme you can use in your VS Code environment.

## Usage
`mona` is currently a simple CLI tool that takes an image file as an input and outputs a `.json` file that provides colors for the fundamental scheme tokens in your editor. 

`mona [path to your image file]`

## Try it out
To try it out, follow these steps:
```
# clone this project
git clone https://github.com/bevensteven/mona.git

# cd into it and install its dependencies
cd mona && npm install

# run the mona executable, you may need to make it an executable first
chmod +x mona && ./mona saatchi_art_sample.png
```

## Future Improvements
- `mona` currently uses `node-vibrant` to extract a color palette from images â€“ this can be quite limiting in that only 6 colors are available.
- The logic and equations used to compute the foreground and background colors for the color scheme is quite rudimentary. More research on color theory and maths would make this logic more reasonable.
- More colors can be added to the color theme. Currently `mona` only adds colors for basic scheme token types.
- The project can leverage more modern developer tools.
- Features can be added to make `mona` more sophisticated and overall better at generating color schemes that better resembles the art/image it was given.
